# 💼 Payroll Management System

A simple *Java-based Payroll System* that manages employee data, calculates salaries, and generates payroll using *Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)* principles like *encapsulation, **inheritance, **abstraction, and **polymorphism*.

---

## 📌 Features

* Add and manage employee details (ID, name, position, salary, etc.)
* Calculate gross salary, deductions, and net salary
* Support for different employee types (e.g., Full-Time, Part-Time, Contract)
* OOP design using classes, objects, and inheritance
* Console-based interface (can be extended to GUI)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java (JDK 8+)
* OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)
* Console I/O (Scanner)
* Collections (ArrayList)

## 🔧 OOP Concepts Applied

| OOP Principle     | How it's Applied                                     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| *Encapsulation* | Private fields and public getters/setters            |
| *Inheritance*   | Employee → FullTimeEmployee / PartTimeEmployee       |
| *Polymorphism*  | Method overriding for salary calculation             |
| *Abstraction*   | Abstract class/interface for base employee structure |
